# pattern of looping is needed to avoid running the body of the loop one extra
# time where "$DIRECTORY" is the empty string.
#
# We could just check if "$DIRECTORY" is the empty string at the beginning of
# the body of the loop, but this pattern is more general-purpose, and it works
# in cases where the body truly shouldn't be run at all for that final newline.
