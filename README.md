These are my configuration files, my shell scripts, and more. Readers may be
interested in my Neovim configuration, my tmux configuration, my shell scripts,
my Bash functions, and my methods of organization. I must admit that my
configuration files are very well-organized.

I've been managing my dotfiles in private source control for years, but I'm only
now beginning to make them public. This will be a gradual process. If something
doesn't seem to work correctly, it may be due to the fact that I'm not done
publishing all of the relevant files.

Please use the [Discussions](https://github.com/openjck/dotfiles/discussions)
page if you'd like to ask any questions or otherwise discuss these dotfiles.
