# Disable SC1090 and SC1091, which are raised when ShellCheck cannot follow a
# non-constant source like "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/profile/init/editors.sh".
#
# I would rather not disable any ShellCheck rules, but I find that the suggested
# workarounds cause more problems than they solve.
#
# The first suggested workaround, providing a "shellcheck source=" directive
# above the affected line, does work, but the provided path must be absolute
# (.e.g., /home/john/.config/sh/utils/__command_exists.sh) and therefore depends
# on the username having a particular value. I imagine it would not work, or
# would necessitate an additional workaround, on any machine where my username
# is not "john".
#
# The second suggested workaround, using the -P or --source-path flag, does not
# work at all for me as of 2021-05-31 and may even have the same problem of
# requiring absolute paths.
