" IdeaVim requires that the IdeaVim configuration file be named .ideavimrc and
" live in the Windows home directory. For the purposes of this comment, we'll
" call that the Windows file.
"
" I'd rather the file live at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ideavim/ideavimrc in WSL so that
" it can be managed by vcsh. For the purposes of this comment, we'll call that
" the WSL file.
"
" On Windows 10, I was able to source the WSL file from the Windows file using
" the `source` feature of Vimscript. On Windows 11, I can't seem to make that
" work. I also haven't had success creating a symbolic link, hard link, or
" Windows shortcut from the Windows file to the WSL file.
"
" Therefore, the "official" version of this file is the Windows file, and any
" changes should be manually copied to the WSL file so that those changes can be
" tracked by vcsh. It's an imperfect solution, but it works.
