Indent input with spaces.

This command may appear to strip color from input, but it doesn't. Rather, many
programs disable color output when output is sent to a piped program. This can
be confirmed by indenting text from a command that is forced to use color, as in
the following example:

  grep --color=always source "\$HOME/.bashrc" | $COMMAND_NAME

Usage:
  $COMMAND_NAME [-s SIZE] [FILE]
  $COMMAND_NAME -h | --help

Examples:
  $COMMAND_NAME .bashrc
  cal | $COMMAND_NAME

Options:
  -s SIZE, --size SIZE
      The number of spaces to indent input with [default: 4]
  -h, --help
      Show this documentation
