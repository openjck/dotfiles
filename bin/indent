This command may appear to strip color from stdin, but it doesn't. Rather, many
programs disable color output when stdout is not a tty, like when stdout is
piped. This can be confirmed by indenting text from a command that is forced to
use color, as in the following example:

  grep --color=always source "\$HOME/.bashrc" | indent

EOF
