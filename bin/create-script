Create a new shell script.

Create a new, empty file with the given name, make it executable, and open it
with the default editor.

If the editor exits with an error code, the file that was created and opened
with the editor will be removed. This can be helpful if the name of FILE is
accidentally misspelled. Simply exit the editor with an error code (e.g., by
running ":cq" in Vim), and the file will be removed.

Usage:
  $COMMAND_NAME FILE
  $COMMAND_NAME -h | --help

Options:
  -h, --help
