Rename files in the current directory, non-recursively, to ordinal, sequential
numbers. The first file according to \$LC_COLLATE is renamed to 1, the second
file is renamed to 2, and so on.

File extensions are preserved. Filenames are padded when appropriate. That is,
if there are 10-99 files, the first file will be named 01, and if there are
100-999 files, the first file will be named 001.

Usage:
  $COMMAND_NAME
  $COMMAND_NAME -h | --help

Options:
  -h, --help
