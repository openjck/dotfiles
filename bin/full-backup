# `tar` may be preferable for creating archives due to the way it handles file
# permissions. `zip` does store file permissions, but in order to restore them,
# the `-X` flag needs to be passed to `unzip`. I can imagine forgetting to do
# that. On the other hand, tar will restore file permissions as long as the
# files are extracted as root, which seems more obvious and may be easier to
# remember, since only root can modify all file permissions.
