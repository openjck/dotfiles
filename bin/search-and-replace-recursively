Recursively replace a string or pattern with a given string, modifying all files

in the "SEARCH" and "REPLACE" arguments:

https://github.com/chmln/sd

Usage:
  $COMMAND_NAME [--backups] SEARCH REPLACE
  $COMMAND_NAME -h | --help

Examples:
  $COMMAND_NAME 'John.*?Karahalis' JK

Options:
  -b, --backups
      Back up all files before performing search and replace. Backups will end
      with the ".$COMMAND_NAME.backup" file extension.
