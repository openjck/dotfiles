These scripts are **not** secret or private. I haven't made a mistake by
publishing them.

Rather, these scripts are highly particular to my personal setup, my personal
needs, and my personal preferences. Feel free to read the code and learn from
it. I hope you do! It's just unlikely that you will want to download and run any
of these scripts as-is; they probably don't do anything that you would want to
do yourself.

For general-purpose scripts that you _may_ be interested in downloading and
using, please see the [general](../general) directory.
