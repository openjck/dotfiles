These scripts are **not** secret or private. I haven't made a mistake by
publishing them.

Rather, these scripts are written for my personal setup, my personal needs, and
my personal preferences. It's pretty unlikely you'll want to run any of these
scripts as-is. That said, please feel free to read the code and learn what you
can from it. As another once said, "I hope you find your explorations
satisfying."

For general-purpose scripts that you _may_ be interested in downloading and
using, please see the [_general_](../general) directory.

If you _do_ want to use any of these scripts, please see the ["Shell scripts"
documentation](../../docs/scripts.md) for installation instructions and other
important information.
