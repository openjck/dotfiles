These scripts are **not** secret or private. I haven't made a mistake by
publishing them.

Rather, these scripts are written for my personal setup, my personal needs, and
my personal preferences. It's pretty unlikely you'll want to run any of these
scripts as-is. That said, please feel free to read the code and learn what you
can from it. As another once said, "I hope you find your explorations
satisfying."

For general-purpose scripts that you _may_ be interested in downloading and
running, please see the [_general_](../general) directory. The README of the
_general_ directory also has some important information that you'll want to know
if you _do_ intend on downloading and running any of the scripts in this
_personal_ directory.
