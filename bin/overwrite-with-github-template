Overwrite files in the current directory with files from a GitHub template. This
can be useful when changes have been made to the template and you'd like to use
those changes in a project which was originally based on the template.

rsync will make backups of all overwritten files in case you had made edits to
them which you'd like to merge back in.

Usage:
  $(basename "$0") IDENTIFIER
  $(basename "$0") -h | --help

Example:
  $(basename "$0") sveltejs/template

Options:
  -h --help  Show this documentation
