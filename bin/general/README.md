These are scripts that others may find useful.

If you have a use for any of these scripts, you are of course encouraged to
download and run them. I worked hard to provide useful error messages, so please
don't ignore them. Most importantly, you will need to install
[docopts](https://github.com/docopt/docopts) before any of these scripts will
work.
