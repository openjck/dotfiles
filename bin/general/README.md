These are scripts that others may find useful.

If you have a use for any of these scripts, you are of course encouraged to
download and run them. All of these scripts depend on
[docopts](https://github.com/docopt/docopts), so be sure to install that first.

I worked hard to provide good documentation and useful error messages, so please
don't ignore them. Once _docopts_ is installed, pass `-h` or `--help` to any
script to read its documentation.
