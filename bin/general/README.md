These are scripts, written by me, which others may want to use themselves.

These scripts are written to be as general as possible, and they make no
assumptions about the person using them. If you have any use for them, I hope
you do download and use them. I worked hard to provide good documentation and
useful error messages in each script, so please _do_ pay attention to those.
Pass the `-h` or `--help` option to any script (e.g., `./indent --help`) to read
the script's documentation.

For installation instructions and other important information, please see the
["Shell scripts" documentation](../../docs/scripts.md).
