These are scripts, written by me, which others may want to use themselves.

These scripts are written to be as general and as self-contained as possible.
They make no assumptions about the person running them, and no script requires
any other script, configuration, or file from this repo to be installed. The
only dependencies are third-party dependencies that should be easy to install.

If you have any use for them, I hope you do download and use them. I worked hard
to provide good documentation and useful error messages in each script, so
please _do_ pay attention to those. Pass the `-h` or `--help` option to any
script (e.g., `./indent --help`) to read the script's documentation.

For installation instructions and other important information, please see the
["Shell scripts" documentation](../../docs/scripts.md).
