# Move everything into a temporary directory first in case there is already a
# file or directory in the current directory with the given name.
#
# For example, this handles the case where there is a directory in the current
# directory named "matryoshka" and the user wants to move it into a new
# directory also named "matryoshka", so that the original directory is named
# "matryoshka/matryoshka".
#
# If this weren't a consideration, we could use this simpler approach:
